# ArchITG

ArchITG is an Arch Linux based distribution developed for modified In the Groove 2 and Dance Dance Revolution arcade machines.
This software is oriented towards a powerful OpenITG experience that cuts down the busy work many users experience when modifying a machine.

This is a fully self-installing distribution with user-friendliness foremost in mind.

To install: 
- Simply download the preferred ISO (Offline for a machine that is not connected to the internet, Online for those that are).
- Use a bootable USB tool such as Rufus (https://rufus.akeo.ie/) and prepare it with the ISO.
- Boot from the USB and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Automated installation!

Once installation is complete, the machine will boot directly into OpenITG.
